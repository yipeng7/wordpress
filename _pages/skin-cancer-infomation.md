</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>Climate of Australia</li>

<strong>&nbsp;</strong>

<strong>When you should see a doctor to prevent, diagnose or treat skin cancer?</strong>

As soon as you feel any of the following symptoms consult your GP:
<ul>
 	<li>any crusty, non-healing sores</li>
 	<li>small lumps that are red, pale or pearly in color</li>
 	<li>new spots, freckles or any moles changing in color, thickness or shape over a period of weeks to months</li>
</ul>
<strong>An earlier diagnosis can save you from surgery, potential disfigurement or even death.</strong>

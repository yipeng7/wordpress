<h3><strong>Skin Cancer Information</strong></h3>
<strong>What is skin cancer and how does it occur?</strong>

Skin cancer is a life-threatening disease. It occurs due to damaged cells in body. One of the major reasons for skin cancer is high exposure to UV rays from the sun.

<strong>Why Australian outdoor workers need to be extra careful?</strong>

<strong>High percentage of skin cancer in Australia:</strong>

Australia has the highest percentage of skin cancer occurrences. Two in three Australians are diagnosed with cancer by the age of 70 years. Every year around 750,000 people are treated for more than one type of skin cancer. Each year 80% of diagnosed cancers have been found to be skin cancer. A large number of skin cancers are caused by exposure to sunlight. Over 1 million patient consultants are for skin cancer treatment every year. In 2015, 2162 people died in Australia due to skin cancer.

<strong> Common risk factors:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Damaged ozone layer</li>
 	<li>Climate of Australia</li>
 	<li>Lighter skin which is sensitive to harsh UV conditions</li>
 	<li>Australia’s proximity to equator which increases UV exposure</li>
 	<li> Excessive outdoor work</li>
</ul>
<strong> </strong>

<strong>When you should see a doctor to prevent, diagnose or treat skin cancer?</strong>

As soon as you feel any of the following symptoms consult your GP:
<ul>
 	<li>any crusty, non-healing sores</li>
 	<li>small lumps that are red, pale or pearly in color</li>
 	<li>new spots, freckles or any moles changing in color, thickness or shape over a period of weeks to months</li>
</ul>
An earlier diagnosis can save you from surgery, potential disfigurement or even death.

<strong>The things you should avoid as an outdoor worker:</strong>

<strong>Sunburn:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>In Australia, sunburn causes around 95% of the most dangerous skin cancers which are melanomas.</li>
 	<li>Sunburn can occur during cool or overcast days too</li>
 	<li>Sun exposure, without sunburn, can also lead to skin cancer</li>
</ul>
<strong>Tanning:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Tanning is a sign of damage from the harmful UV rays</li>
 	<li>It increases your chances of skin cancer</li>
 	<li>A tanned skin only provides very little protection from UV rays equivalent to SPF3 and does not protect your DNA</li>
</ul>
<strong> </strong>

<strong>Solarium:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Emit UVA and UVB which cause cancer</li>
 	<li>Cancer Council discourages the use of solarium for cosmetic tanning</li>
 	<li>Commercial solarium have been banned in Australia previously</li>
</ul>
